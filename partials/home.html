      <h2>Comments</h2>
      <p>If "The Bank Job" were fiction, it would be a fairly decent robbery caper. As it is, "The Bank Job," a veritable documentary and realistic whodunit, is awesome.</p>
      <p> The cast is remarkable: Jason Statham is the ringleader, the bad guy of "Transporter" and "The Italian Job" turning into a scourge of the really bad guys.</p>

      <h2>Cast</h2>
      <p>Saffron Burrows brings her remarkable name and looks to the criminally and emotionally ambiguous major female role. Peter De Jersey is a totally scary Michael X; David ("Poirot") Suchet is a frightening crime lord; and a whole host of top British stage actors fill in big roles and small ones.</p>
